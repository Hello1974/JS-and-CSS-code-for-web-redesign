        <h3>In Memoriam: Mel Bochner</h3>
        <p>I would like to note Mel Bochner’s passing on February 12, 2025. He was a valued colleague, a brilliant interlocutor, never brought less than his A-game to studio visits and reviews, he had a voice that brought insight to the conversation, and had an outstanding sense of humor. I was fortunate to be his colleague. Students felt fortunate for the exchange they shared. He never varnished his truth. May he rest in peace. <p>
